I am an Economics and Finance student at Al-Imam Muhammad Ibn Saud Islamic University \
with a strong foundation in market analysis. For the past two years, I have navigated \
the complexities of equity and forex markets as an independent trader, sharpening my \
ability to interpret global geopolitical shifts and financial news.

My technical proficiency is backed by certifications from the Indonesia Stock Exchange \
(IDX) and the Ministry of Finance, alongside virtual experience programs with Bloomberg, \
BCG, Citi, and SIDF. I am committed to evolving within the finance industry, aiming to \
leverage my analytical rigor and market insights as a future Equity Analyst or \
Investment Banker.
