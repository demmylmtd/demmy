I am excited to share my experience participating in a virtual work program focused on Islamic Finance, powered by Bloomberg in collaboration with the Misk Foundation. This journey allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical Islamic economic principles and real-world financial engineering using industry-standard tools like the Bloomberg Terminal.

#### First Task: Sharia Compliance & Equity Screening

In this initial phase, I utilized Bloomberg’s analytical tools to critique corporate entities based on Sharia law. I applied strict screening filters, such as ensuring total interest-bearing debt and cash equivalents are each less than 33% of total assets.

#### Second Task: Underwriter & Market Sentiment Analysis

Using Bloomberg Terminal tools, I performed an underwriter analysis to gauge market depth. I observed a "flight to safety" dynamic in Saudi German Health (SGH), where investors preferred the security of debt (Sukuk) over equity volatility.

#### Third Task: Government Debt Instrument Analysis

I shifted focus to the macro level by analyzing three representative high-performing Saudi Government Sukuk via the Saudi Exchange. I identified that the KSA Sukuk 2041 offers a high-yield leader at 5.15%, reflecting a "term premium" for long-term debt.

#### Fourth Task: The Aramco Strategic Green Sukuk (PPCR)

The final task involved architecting a Wakala-Mudaraba Hybrid Sukuk for Aramco, aimed at financing the transition to Green Hydrogen and Carbon Capture. This structure maintains a >51% tangible asset ratio to ensure Sharia-compliant secondary market tradeability.

Conclusion
This experience has solidified my expertise in Financial Modeling, Sukuk Structuring, and Capital Markets. By leveraging Bloomberg's ecosystem, I have developed a data-driven approach to Islamic Investment Banking that I look forward to applying in my professional career.
